# Pull Request Summary

## Issue Resolution

This PR addresses the issue: "On DynamicOctree.hpp, I would like for DynamicOctree::insert function to check if the new item that will be inserted, if it's too big to be contained in a sub node and if the numbers of already item exceed the _CAPACITY, then take the first item in the that is small enough to be contained in a sub node and add the big item in the current item list."

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `DynamicOctree::insert()` Function

**File:** `DynamicOctree.hpp`
**Lines:** 142-180 (new code block added)

**Implementation:**
- Added capacity management logic after the main insertion loop
- Checks if the new item is too large to fit in any sub-node
- If capacity is exceeded and item doesn't fit in sub-nodes:
  - Searches through existing items at current level
  - Finds the first item that CAN fit in a sub-node
  - Moves that item to the appropriate sub-node
  - Adds the large item to current level

**Code Summary:**
```cpp
// Check if item is too big to fit in any sub-node and capacity is exceeded
if (_DEPTH > 0 && _pItems.size() >= _CAPACITY)
{
    bool itemFitsInSubNode = false;
    // Check all 8 sub-nodes
    
    if (!itemFitsInSubNode)
    {
        // Find an existing item that fits in a sub-node
        // Move it to sub-node
        // Add large item to current level
    }
}
```

### 2. Added Documentation

**File:** `OCTREE_CAPACITY_MANAGEMENT.md`

Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Problem statement and solution
- Code examples demonstrating the feature
- Technical implementation details
- Performance analysis
- Edge cases and limitations
- Testing verification

### 3. Added Example Program

**File:** `example_capacity_management.cpp`

Demonstrates the new feature with:
- Step-by-step insertion scenario
- Clear explanation of behavior
- Visual output showing capacity management in action

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(1) - No rebalancing needed
- **Average Case:** O(n) where n is items at current level
- **Worst Case:** O(n*8) - Check all items against all sub-nodes

### Key Benefits
1. **Maintains Capacity Constraints:** Prevents unbounded growth at any level
2. **Handles Large Objects:** Properly accommodates objects that span multiple sub-nodes
3. **Automatic Rebalancing:** Transparently optimizes spatial partitioning
4. **Backward Compatible:** No changes required to existing code

### Edge Cases Handled
- Leaf nodes (_DEPTH == 0): No rebalancing attempted
- Under capacity: Existing behavior preserved
- No suitable items: Large item still added (graceful degradation)
- All items large: Capacity may temporarily exceed (rare case)

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created standalone test program that validates:
- ✓ Normal insertion (under capacity) works correctly
- ✓ Capacity management triggers when appropriate
- ✓ Items are correctly moved to sub-nodes
- ✓ Large items are added to root level
- ✓ Total item count is preserved
- ✓ Child nodes are created as needed

### Test Scenario
1. Insert 4 small items (10x10x10 each) - fills capacity
2. Insert 1 large item (60x60x60) - spans multiple sub-nodes
3. Verify: One small item moved to sub-node, large item at root
4. Verify: Total = 5 items, Root = 4 items, Child = 1 item

## Code Quality

### Changes Follow Repository Standards
- Consistent with existing code style
- Proper use of `noexcept` specifier
- Clear, descriptive comments
- Minimal changes to existing logic

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing functionality preserved
- All existing code paths work as before
- New logic only activates when specific conditions met

## Files Modified/Added

1. **DynamicOctree.hpp** - Modified (40 lines added)
2. **OCTREE_CAPACITY_MANAGEMENT.md** - Added (125 lines)
3. **example_capacity_management.cpp** - Added (112 lines)

## Verification

The implementation has been:
- ✓ Tested with standalone test program
- ✓ Verified against problem statement requirements
- ✓ Documented with examples and technical details
- ✓ Checked for edge cases and error conditions

## Next Steps

No additional work required. The feature is:
- Fully implemented
- Thoroughly tested
- Comprehensively documented
- Ready for review and merge
